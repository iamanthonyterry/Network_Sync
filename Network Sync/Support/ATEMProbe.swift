// MARK: - ATEM Reachability Probe
//
// Blackmagic ATEM switchers speak a proprietary protocol over UDP on port
// 9910 — they never accept plain TCP connections there, so a TCP "ping"
// always reports offline even when the switcher is powered on and healthy.
//
// This sends the protocol's real opening handshake packet over UDP and
// treats any reply from the switcher as proof it's alive. We don't need to
// parse the response — just seeing one is enough for a reachability check.
//
// Marked `nonisolated` throughout: this is pure background networking with
// no UI state, so it shouldn't be pinned to the main actor.
